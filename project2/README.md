# Project 2

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This project contains Flack, an online web messaging application that allows users to create channels and communicte through them. This application uses Javascript, SocketIo, FLask along with HTML5 jinja2 elements.

Whenever a new user enters the webpage, the user is prompted to type in a display name which is used to identify the user. The user can later create channels and type in messages in those channels. Messages are automatically updated as soon as they are sent. 

My personal touch is the added functionality to delete the message. If the user hovers over the text they sent, then a small 'x' shaped css styled icon appears beside the message. If the user clicks on this icon the sent message will be deleted. A user can only delete their own message and cannot do use this feature on a message sent by someone else.
